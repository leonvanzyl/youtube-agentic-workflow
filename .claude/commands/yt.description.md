description: Generate SEO-optimized video descriptions with keywords, timestamps, and calls-to-action
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

---

## Goal

Create a comprehensive, SEO-optimized video description that:
- Hooks viewers in the first 2-3 lines (visible before "Show More")
- Incorporates keywords naturally for search discovery
- Provides structured content overview with timestamps
- Includes relevant links and resources
- Contains effective calls-to-action for engagement
- Stays within YouTube's 5000 character limit
- Adds genuine value beyond the video content

---

## Operating Constraints

**ANALYSIS REQUIRED**: This command requires an existing analysis.md file with keyword data.

**MOBILE-FIRST**: First 150 characters are CRITICAL (visible on mobile without expanding).

**KEYWORD INTEGRATION**: Must be natural, not stuffed. Keywords should flow conversationally.

**TIMESTAMP INCLUSION**: Required for videos over 5 minutes (helps with suggested clips and user navigation).

**CALL-TO-ACTION BALANCE**: Engaging but not pushy. Focus on value, not begging.

**CHARACTER LIMIT**: Maximum 5000 characters total.

---

## Input Handling

### With Project Name
If user provides a project name: `$ARGUMENTS = "project-name"`
- Use: `youtube/content/[project-name]/analysis.md`

### Without Project Name
If user provides no arguments:
1. List available projects in `youtube/content/`
2. If only one project exists, use it automatically
3. If multiple exist, ask user to specify which project

### With Additional Context
If user provides context like: "include link to course" or "mention the GitHub repo"
- Use the most recent project (or prompt to specify)
- Incorporate their specific requirements into description

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Load Context

1. **Locate required files**:
   ```
   ANALYSIS_FILE = youtube/content/[project-name]/analysis.md
   TITLES_FILE = youtube/content/[project-name]/titles.md (if exists)
   HOOK_FILE = youtube/content/[project-name]/hook.md (if exists)
   ```

2. **Read and extract key information**:

   **From Analysis**:
   - Primary keywords (for SEO)
   - Secondary keywords (for natural distribution)
   - Long-tail keywords (for specific search queries)
   - Target audience (for language/tone)
   - Content vibe (for description style)
   - Unique value proposition (for value communication)
   - Key points covered (for content overview section)

   **From Titles** (if available):
   - Chosen or recommended title (for consistency)
   - Title strategy (browse/search focus)

   **From Hook** (if available):
   - Main value propositions mentioned
   - Key points to highlight

3. **If analysis file not found**:
   ```
   ERROR: "No analysis found for '[project-name]'. Please run /yt.analyze first."
   ```

---

### Step 2: Description Strategy Planning

Based on analysis, determine description approach:

#### SEO Priority Assessment

**High SEO Priority** (Search-focused content):
- Keyword density: 2-4 mentions of primary keyword
- Keyword placement: Primary keyword in first 25 words
- Long-tail phrases: Include 3-5 specific search phrases
- Structured format: Clear sections with headers

**Medium SEO Priority** (Balanced):
- Keyword density: 1-2 mentions of primary keyword
- Natural integration: Keywords flow conversationally
- Mixed content: Both searchable and engaging elements

**Low SEO Priority** (Browse-focused):
- Keyword presence: Primary keyword mentioned once naturally
- Focus: Engagement, personality, community building
- Style: More conversational, less structured

#### Tone and Style Mapping

From content vibe:
- **Educational**: Clear, organized, helpful
- **Entertaining**: Casual, personality-driven, fun
- **Professional**: Authoritative, data-backed, formal
- **Inspirational**: Motivational, transformative, aspirational

---

### Step 3: Generate Primary Description (First 150 Characters)

**CRITICAL SECTION**: This appears before "Show More" on mobile.

#### Primary Description Requirements:

1. **Hook** (First 40 characters):
   - Immediate value or intrigue
   - Connect to title
   - Create reason to keep reading/watching

2. **Value Proposition** (Next 60 characters):
   - What viewer will learn/gain
   - Specific outcome or benefit
   - Align with video promise

3. **Call-to-Action or Credibility** (Remaining 50 characters):
   - Encourage watching
   - Establish authority
   - Create urgency or excitement

#### Primary Description Formula:

```
[Hook sentence that connects to title]. [What you'll learn/discover].
[CTA or credibility statement].
```

**Character count target**: 150-200 characters

#### Keyword Placement:

Primary keyword should appear in first 25 words if content is search-focused.

## Description Writing Guidelines

### Above-the-Fold Strategy

The first 2-3 lines are EVERYTHING for mobile users:

**BAD** ‚ùå:
```
Hey everyone! In today's video, we're going to be talking about something
really cool that I think you'll find interesting...
```

**GOOD** ‚úÖ:
```
Spending hours on repetitive code? This automation workflow cuts that time
by 80%. Here's exactly how to set it up in 15 minutes.
```

---

### Keyword Integration Best Practices

**Natural Integration** ‚úÖ:
```
"If you're learning Claude Code for the first time, this tutorial walks you
through the essential automation features that save the most time."
```

**Keyword Stuffing** ‚ùå:
```
"Claude Code Claude Code automation tutorial. Learn Claude Code. Best Claude
Code tutorial. Claude Code tips."
```

---

### Timestamp Strategy

**Effective Timestamps** ‚úÖ:
```
‚è±Ô∏è 0:00 - Why automation matters
‚è±Ô∏è 2:15 - Setup and installation
‚è±Ô∏è 5:30 - First automation example
‚è±Ô∏è 9:45 - Advanced techniques
‚è±Ô∏è 14:20 - Common mistakes to avoid
```

**Poor Timestamps** ‚ùå:
```
0:00 Intro
5:00 Main content
15:00 Outro
```

Make them descriptive and valuable!

---

### Call-to-Action Effectiveness

**Specific and Value-Focused** ‚úÖ:
```
üí¨ Drop a comment with your biggest automation challenge - I read and
respond to every one!
```

**Generic and Pushy** ‚ùå:
```
Like and subscribe!!! Please!!! Click the bell!!!
```

---

### Mobile Formatting

Use these techniques for mobile readability:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Emoji for visual breaks and section markers
- Clear spacing between sections
- Bullet points or numbered lists
- All caps for section headers (sparingly)

---

## Quality Validation

Before reporting completion, verify:

- [ ] First 150 characters are compelling
- [ ] Primary keyword appears in first 25 words (if search-focused)
- [ ] Total character count under 5000
- [ ] Timestamps included (if relevant)
- [ ] At least 3 calls-to-action
- [ ] Engagement question included
- [ ] Links formatted correctly
- [ ] Hashtags relevant (3-5 max)
- [ ] No keyword stuffing
- [ ] About section included
