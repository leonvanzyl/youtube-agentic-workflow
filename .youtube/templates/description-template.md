**FORMAT**: Single-line entries (emoji + description + URL all on one line)

```
[Priority order: Sponsors ‚Üí Affiliates ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí Support]

[RESOURCES DYNAMICALLY EXTRACTED FROM TRANSCRIPT]:
üìö [Resource description based on video context]: [URL]
üîß [Another resource with suitable emoji]: [URL]

‚òï Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/leonvanzyl
üíµ Donate using PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/EKRQ8QSGV6CWW
```

**Link Strategy Notes**:
- **Single-line format**: Everything on one line (emoji + description + URL)
- **Priority order**: 1) Sponsors (always first), 2) Affiliates (WisprFlow, n8n), 3) Resources (dynamically extracted from transcript), 4) Support (coffee, PayPal)
- **Resources are auto-extracted**: The command analyzes your video transcript for mentions of docs, tools, GitHub repos, other videos, etc.
- Use welcoming, casual descriptions with suitable emojis
- ALWAYS include Buy me a coffee and PayPal at the end
- Resource links will have `[URL]` placeholders - fill these in before uploading

### 2. SEO Opening Paragraph

**Word Count**: [X words] (Target: Maximum 200 words)

```
[The opening paragraph that hooks viewers and includes natural keyword integration.
First 150 characters should be compelling for mobile users.]
```

**Keywords Used**:
- Primary: [keyword] - [X mentions]
- Secondary: [keyword1], [keyword2] - naturally integrated

**IMPORTANT**: This comes AFTER the links section in the final description

---

### 3. Timestamps

**Extracted From**: [subtitle-file.srt/vtt]
**Total Timestamps**: [X]

```
‚è±Ô∏è TIMESTAMPS:
00:00 [SEO-Optimized Label]
01:15 [SEO-Optimized Label]
02:22 [SEO-Optimized Label]
[Continue for all major points...]
```

**Timestamp Guidelines**:
- **Maximum 5 words per timestamp**
- **SEO-optimized using keywords from analysis.md**
- Use primary and secondary keywords naturally
- Make labels descriptive but concise
- Example: "Building n8n AI Agent" not "Setting up and configuring the n8n AI automation agent workflow"

**Notes**: Timestamps extracted from subtitle track by identifying topic changes and key discussion points. Labels must incorporate relevant keywords while staying under 5 words.

### 4. Hashtags

```
#[videospecific] #[industryspecific] #[broadappeal]
```

**Strategy**:
- **#[videospecific]** - Video-specific (main topic/keyword from video)
- **#[industryspecific]** - Industry-specific (broader category/niche)
- **#[broadappeal]** - Broad appeal (reaches wider audience)
