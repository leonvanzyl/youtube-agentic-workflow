## Components Breakdown

### 1. Links Section

**IMPORTANT**: Links go at the TOP of the description (above SEO paragraph)

**FORMAT**: Single-line entries (emoji + description + URL all on one line)

```
[Priority order: Sponsors ‚Üí Affiliates ‚Üí Support ‚Üí Resources]

[ADD SPONSOR LINKS HERE IF APPLICABLE - ALWAYS FIRST]:
üéÅ [Sponsor Product Name with compelling CTA]: [URL]
Coupon Code: [CODE] (if applicable)

üí¨ Want my full voice to text software? Check out WisprFlow: https://wisprflow.ai/r?LEON114
üöÄ Start building with n8n (use my link to support my channel ‚ù§Ô∏è): https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/f7f19w3vrhin

‚òï Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/leonvanzyl
üíµ Donate using PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/EKRQ8QSGV6CWW

[RESOURCES DYNAMICALLY EXTRACTED FROM TRANSCRIPT]:
üìö [Resource description based on video context]: [URL]
üîß [Another resource with suitable emoji]: [URL]
(These are auto-generated - just fill in the URLs)
```

**Link Strategy Notes**:
- **Single-line format**: Everything on one line (emoji + description + URL)
- **Priority order**: 1) Sponsors (always first), 2) Affiliates (WisprFlow, n8n), 3) Support (coffee, PayPal), 4) Resources (dynamically extracted from transcript)
- **Resources are auto-extracted**: The command analyzes your video transcript for mentions of docs, tools, GitHub repos, other videos, etc.
- Use welcoming, casual descriptions with suitable emojis
- ALWAYS include Buy me a coffee and PayPal after affiliates and before resources
- Resource links will have `[URL]` placeholders - fill these in before uploading

### 2. SEO Opening Paragraph

**Word Count**: [X words] (Target: 150-250 words, Maximum 300 words)

```
[The opening paragraph that hooks viewers and includes natural keyword integration.
First 150 characters should be compelling for mobile users.]
```

**Keywords Used**:
- Primary: [keyword] - [X mentions]
- Secondary: [keyword1], [keyword2] - naturally integrated

**IMPORTANT**: This comes AFTER the links section in the final description

---

### 3. Timestamps

**Extracted From**: [subtitle-file.srt/vtt]
**Total Timestamps**: [X] (based on main talking points identified in content)

```
‚è±Ô∏è TIMESTAMPS:
00:00 - [SEO-Optimized Label]
[timestamp] - [SEO-Optimized Label]
[timestamp] - [SEO-Optimized Label]
[Continue for each main talking point...]
```

**Timestamp Guidelines**:
- **Content-driven count**: Number of timestamps based on actual subjects discussed (not a target number)
- **Each timestamp = a distinct subject/talking point**
- **Identify subject changes**: When content shifts to new specific topics or instructions
- **Maximum 5 words per timestamp**
- **SEO-optimized using keywords from analysis.md**
- Use primary and secondary keywords naturally
- Make labels clearly describe what subject is being discussed
- **Skip examples and details**: Only timestamp when a new main subject begins
- Example: "Building n8n AI Agent" ‚úÖ not "Setting up and configuring the n8n AI automation agent workflow" ‚ùå

**Notes**: Timestamps extracted from subtitle track by identifying main talking points and subject changes. Labels must incorporate relevant keywords while staying under 5 words. Each timestamp represents a distinct subject or topic being discussed.

### 4. Hashtags

```
#[videospecific] #[industryspecific] #[broadappeal]
```

**Strategy**:
- **#[videospecific]** - Video-specific (main topic/keyword from video)
- **#[industryspecific]** - Industry-specific (broader category/niche)
- **#[broadappeal]** - Broad appeal (reaches wider audience)
