üìö [RESOURCES MENTIONED IN VIDEO]:

```

**Link Strategy Notes**:
- Use Nate's style: emoji + compelling CTA/description + URL on separate line
- **Priority order**: 1) Sponsors (always first), 2) Affiliates (WisprFlow, n8n), 3) Resources
- Keep descriptions short but persuasive

### 2. SEO Opening Paragraph

```

[Continue for all major points...]
```

**Timestamp Guidelines**:
- **Maximum 5 words per timestamp**
- **SEO-optimized using keywords from analysis.md**
- Use primary and secondary keywords naturally
- Make labels descriptive but concise
- Example: "Building n8n AI Agent" not "Setting up and configuring the n8n AI automation agent workflow"
